# netflix_data_analysis
Analyze the data and generate insights that could help Netflix in deciding which type of shows/movies to produce and how they can grow the business in different countries.

Here we have assumed that movies/tv shows available are popular in respective countries. With this assumption we can analyze the genres, actors, directors and even length of movies/tv shows for each country.

Visual and non-visual analysis along with insights can be found in attached jupyter notebook.
